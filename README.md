# Monet Scrape

A lightweight Node.js scraper to check availability of tickets for a local Monet exhibit.

## Usage

`npm i`
then
`npm start`

Note: An email SMTP server will need to be set up before this scraper
 will send an email if there are tickets available. Otherwise,
 only a console message will be displayed.
